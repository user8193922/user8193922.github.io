It's August 20th. No, I'm not going to that thing in Hampton.

I need to get new glasses for college. The prescription on my white ones are not gonna do me justice, especially if I sit back row or something. Plus, it's time I need 
something more stylish. I also really like Asu's glasses. I want to get some sort of those. 

I just feel lost. I don't know what I like. I feel like I haven't discovered something I'm passionate about. I don't like coding. I just view it as a tool to accomplish
other things. I'm not crazy about physics, but I'd say I like it more than CS. Math is OK with me, but I'm not too crazy over it. I like math more than the other two. But forget about all the future career hopes, I just feel lost in general.

I miss my grandfather. I wish I could have took oneo year off from school and just spent time with him. Wish I could have went to college there. I'll really go the rest of my life without knowing that I
made a connection with him. The only thing I will know is that I didn't try to make a connection with him. I really wonder if he remembers me. What I meant to him, if anything.

i just feel hopeless in so many things I do nowadays. I know I have college in a month, but it's just not at the forefront of my mind. I feel like I could die right now and
be satisfied with what I've accomplished. Not even satisfied, but just done with it all. I don't know what I want to do. 

I miss having one family. I miss alwyas being happy with my friends up in New York and just playing the whole day. Playing soccer with my dad at Red Mill. Always spending
time with my mom. I just wish I could go back to sometime that's not now. And I feel hopeless knowing that'll never happen.

I remmeber when Jiu-Jitsu was my life. I was so worried when I'd do bad in rolling with the others, scared of my dad shouting at me in the car. Knowing that he'd spend 
even more hours with me training a specific technique. Damn. If I could just live one of those days again. 

I remmeber when we'd all eat together at the dinner table. Drinking 7-Ups. Every night. Isn't that something to think about. Soda every night. Treated it as normal. When I stole
the Pirouline and blamed it on the workers who came over that one time. And then mom finding the can under my bed. Hiding in the hallway closet in Brinsmade. Damn.

I miss Naisean. I need to go back to New York and spend time with him. Damn. Remember spending days at his basement playing 2K and watching Rick and Morty. Or playing basketball
at the court behind the church. With Rami. 

I'm all alone. I have no one to reach out to now. I've been in this position a few times, but not like this. I don't care that I'm going to Stanford. Fuck Stanford. I don't
give a flying fuck if someone went to MIT or Harvard or whatever shit fucking school. It's all branding anyways. I bet I could learn what I'm going to learn in 4 years of undergraduate
in one year if I had the motivation. No, I'm not being emotional. I say that rationally. I'd have absolutely no problem dropping out of Stanford right now and just wandering the streets.

I have absolutely no people to talk to. This is my only form of communication. I say no words anymore to anyone. Maybe a couple of thank yous after buying a soda or Sour Patch Kids,
but nothing more.

I'm such a fraud. I'm the reason why I ended up here. It's all my fault. Why are some babies born with Stage 4 cancer? What's the fucking point? I did it to myself,
and now I'm paying the costs. All because I cared what people think. I spent time hating other people, and brandishing my self-image so other people would like me. 
Now there's nothing to me. And I can't point fingers. Not at my dad. Not at my mom. Not at the environemnt I grew up in. Not at the education system, or my friedns.

Just me. I'm a wicked man, Fyodor. An unattractive one. i did it all to myslef. And I knew this from the start. Never changing for the better. Always fucking cheating your way through things.

One day it'll catch up to you. Hell, it is already. Look what you're doing right now. Look at who you've damaged. Me and you have a lot in common, Jimmy.4

I wish I could take a different path in life. Hopefully I'm able to correct myself for the future. No more of this. I just can't live like this.
