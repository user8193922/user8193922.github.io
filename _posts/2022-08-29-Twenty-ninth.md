August 29. I find myself coming back here whenever I miss my grandfather. I finally realized the itchy joke that he said to me. It's the equivalent of a homophone in English,
where he said a phrase that asked me if I was itchy, but also meant if I wanted to get beaten. Funny how those two phrases are the same sounds in Chinese. Funny joke. 

Really hoping I can make him proud.
