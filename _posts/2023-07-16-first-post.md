Hi all.

Take 2. Hopefully this one lasts longer.

I wanted to just jot down some things I've been feeling in life recently. I don't want to give too many details/personally identifying facts away, so I'll try to keep it vague. I'm doing a summer
internship in Seattle. I'm not from here, and I don't really know anyone here. I'm pretty young to be doing what I'm doing. Currently, I'm up at 2:16 AM writing this.

My internship, so far, has been pretty anticlimactic. I was under the impression that I would be assigned/doing more work than what I'm doing now, but there's some days I go without doing anything for my 
job. It's pretty crazy. I'm getting paid pretty well for it too, which is even crazier. 

To combat this boredom, I've finally gotten around to starting on this side project that's been eating at my mind for a couple months now. I don't know if I want to talk about it on here
(or maybe I'm just subconsciously saving it for a future post), but it keeps me entertained and thinking too much about things.

Things have been peaceful. I live by myself. A lot of days go by without me opening my mouth to speak. I feel alone, but I wouldn't say in a bad way. Sure, it would be nice to talk to more people.
I don't really know how I feel about things to be honest. I did this all to myself - in fact, I wanted this for myself. I can see myself living like this for the rest of my life, but I do feel 
like I have more to do. I don't feel particularly fulfilled by this work or way of life.
