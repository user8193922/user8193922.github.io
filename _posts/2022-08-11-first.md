I am sitting in my bedroom typing this. I created this blog for the purpose of logging my daily thoughts. I find it increasingly difficult to keep record of all the
ideas that I have, and I don't think the Notes app on my phone is a good alternative. It isn't that the "ideas that I have" on a daily basis are ingenious or extremely
creative, but it's random views and impressions that run through my head that I want to write somewhere down.

It is mid-August, meaning I am in my bedroom for the rest of the summer before I head off to my first year of college. I have a few projects and goals 
that I am currently working towards, which I can detail in a later post.

Let this statement be a reminder to my future self that I do not have to keep this — and preferably, I shouldn't — strictly/purely academic.
