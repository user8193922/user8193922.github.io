Wow. Three posts in one day. Must be some sort of record I broke.

I feel an urge to drink this Elmer's I have on my desk. No idea why. I guess I'm a pretty weird guy (American Psycho reference).

Would the Elmer's harden halfway through my throat? Or through my intestine tracts. Maybe my tongue would just get this Elmer's coating that would harden it for the rest of 
my life. Would be pretty funny. Hard to eat with, though.

I really wonder when'd it harden. Maybe there's some way to heat the Elmer's to prolong the time it takes to harden. So then that way it could harden in my stomach and then
I'd never be hungry again. Would be funny. Can start shitting things of value instead of those fucking Krinkle Cut chips I hogged from my friend. Asshole. And I know you regret
that now. Fucking asshole.
