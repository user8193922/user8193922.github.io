Yo. I met that dude in Hampton. Pretty glad I went. I know I said I wasn't going; guess I changed my mind.

He was really nice. Got to know his experience with Stanford and all. He played football and studied Math and Communications. Football and math. Interesting combo.

You'd think football players would study something like STS or SS or something light like that. Respect to him.

Anyways, the food was average. Got a average burger that had a chicken tender in the middle. Weird combo.

I got new glasses too. Ordered them, I mean.
