I felt obligated to make this post. I hope this blog doesn't become some place where I can just shit my depressing feelings out. I want to look back here
and get a sense of what I was feeling and thinking when I'm older, and I don't feel like the last posts 24/7.

So on a different note:

I'm almost done with Season 5 of Better Call Saul. Pretty good show. Can't say I relate to Jimmy or a lot of the characters, but I really like the show so far. I like the 
change of pacing from Breaking Bad. Bravo Vince. 

I've been thinking of my grandfather an awful lot recently. Maybe it's because I want to cry or feel something sad. But sometimes I can't help but wonder what I meant to him. 
I never spoke to him in his language, yet we spent so much time in each other's presence. He fed me, took me to McDonald's when language barriers persisted, and always
treated me with kindness. I remember the last time I spoke with him on the phone. He asked me in Cantonese if I had a girlfriend yet. And he said to get one from
Hong Kong because they're cheaper. Wish I could have got to known him more. Probably still the biggest regret I have. People are always boasting my intelligence around,
but I didn't even use my brains to do something that has been the most important thing to me in life. I also remember waiting on a train late at night in Hong Kong and scratching 
myself. He said some sort of play-on-words joke that went over my head, and my Mom explained it to me. Something about me being itchy. Can't really explain it, or remember it
right even. 

He's the kindest person I know. Really. You could just tell. I could tell without even speaking to him or understanding half the things he said. 
And I'm a pretty rational person. The way he'd look out for me and play. I remember when I was deadset on going to college in Hong Kong because I wanted to live with him.
Plans change, I guess. The strongest and kindest person I know. I'll never be as  understanding and moral as him. I doubt a lot of people could have the strength to 
do what he did. I wish I could make a time machine and go back and learn Cantonese to talk to him. More motivation for a Physics major. 

I hope I make him proud. I don't wanna sit around in an office and make a shit ton of money with nothing to show for it. Hope he can look down on me and be proud.
