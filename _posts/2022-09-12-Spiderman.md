Sorry I haven't been posting much lately. Probably a good sign, anyways.

The Spiderman movie just popped into my head recently. Thought about how he always came home to his apartment as a regular dude, just as a student and no one else. No one
to talk to other than his family, just focused on himself. Lived in a small apartment, and led a simple life. Had a job as some newspaper guy, regular job. But his life 
really started when he became Spiderman, when he fought crime and shit. Where's my Spiderman? Insult to the rest of us. Bad writing on Stan's part.

I write this as I sip water out of my Caltech bottle. How ironic.
