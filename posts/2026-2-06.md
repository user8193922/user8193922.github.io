I think I portray myself as a very non-second-guessing and confident type of person to my friends. 

I think I am a very unconfident person generally. I envy a lot of my friends about how they're secure in a lot of things.

I haven't done enough proper reflecting on why this may be, or whether or not this is an issue, etc.

It's very easy to do comparing with things that you're familiar with. I'm a very unsure person in general, but I think from the objective side of me, this comparing feels very natural and intuitive to do.

On the other hand, I do think that like I can be very confident in something, but at the same time, still doubt myself. I think that I can doubt and second guess a lot on something that I'm extremely confident in.
