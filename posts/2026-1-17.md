This is thirdish(?) time that I'm starting a blog. I want to start this one with no focus. 

I want to blog about what I eat, how I feel, anything cool I learn or work on, anything. This is more meant for me, too, so I could look back on it. 

Time has been flying be so fast, I reflected the other day. There's a bunch of stuff I want to change about myself. I think the last time I tried to start a blog was during my Microsoft internship.
